# concurrent-programming-lab-1
This repo is dedicated for "Lab 1" of CS4532 Concurrent Programming. In this lab we will learn how to develop parallel programs using the Pthread library. We will also compare the performance of different implementations.

## Compiling
gcc .\LinkedList_main.c LinkedList.c .\LinkedList.h -std=c99

## Running the program
a.exe
